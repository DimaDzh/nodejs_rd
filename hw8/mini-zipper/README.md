# Mini Zipper - Thumbnail Generator

A NestJS application that processes ZIP files containing images and generates thumbnails using worker threads for parallel processing.

## Features

- **Worker Threads**: Utilizes Node.js worker threads for parallel image processing
- **Thread Safety**: Implements mutex to ensure atomic updates to shared counters
- **Sharp Integration**: Uses Sharp library for high-performance image processing
- **Concurrent Uploads**: Supports multiple simultaneous ZIP file uploads
- **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive logging with thread IDs for debugging

## Project Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
$ pnpm install
```

## Running the Application

```bash
# Development mode
$ pnpm run start:dev

# Production mode
$ pnpm run start:prod
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:3000`

## API Usage

### Upload and Process ZIP File

**Endpoint:** `POST /zip`  
**Content-Type:** `multipart/form-data`

```bash
# Upload a ZIP file containing images
curl -F "file=@your-images.zip" http://localhost:3000/zip
```

**Example Response:**

```json
{
  "processed": 5,
  "skipped": 2,
  "durationMs": 1234.56,
  "totalFiles": 7
}
```

**Response Fields:**

- `processed`: Number of images successfully converted to thumbnails
- `skipped`: Number of files skipped (non-images or processing failures)
- `durationMs`: Total processing time in milliseconds
- `totalFiles`: Total number of files in the ZIP archive

## Supported Image Formats

- JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg)
- PNG (.png)

Non-image files are automatically skipped and counted in the `skipped` field.

## Thread Safety & Debugging

The application implements the following thread safety measures:

1. **Mutex Protection**: Shared counters are protected by a mutex to prevent race conditions
2. **Atomic Operations**: Uses `Atomics` API for thread-safe counter updates
3. **Worker Thread Logging**: Each worker logs its thread ID for debugging:
   ```
   [Worker 2] Started processing file: /tmp/abc123/image1.jpg
   [Worker 3] Started processing file: /tmp/abc123/image2.jpg
   ```

## Monitoring Worker Threads

You can monitor active worker threads using system tools:

```bash
# View all Node.js processes and threads
ps -eLf | grep node

# Monitor CPU usage by thread
top -H -p $(pgrep node)

# Real-time process monitoring
htop
```

## Testing Concurrent Uploads

Test the server's ability to handle multiple concurrent uploads:

```bash
# Upload multiple files simultaneously
curl -F "file=@test1.zip" http://localhost:3000/zip &
curl -F "file=@test2.zip" http://localhost:3000/zip &
curl -F "file=@test3.zip" http://localhost:3000/zip &
wait
```

The server logs will show different request IDs and worker thread IDs processing in parallel.

## Architecture

- **Main Thread**: Handles HTTP requests and coordinates worker creation
- **Worker Threads**: Process individual images using Sharp library
- **Shared Memory**: Uses `SharedArrayBuffer` for thread-safe counter updates
- **Mutex**: Ensures atomic updates to prevent race conditions

## Development

```bash
# Run tests
$ pnpm run test

# Run linting
$ pnpm run lint

# Format code
$ pnpm run format
```

$ pnpm run test

# e2e tests

$ pnpm run test:e2e

# test coverage

$ pnpm run test:cov
